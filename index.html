			<p>TRF strives to prevent future cruelty towards horses by educating the community on responsible equine stewardship. </p>
			<p>The TRF Second Chances Program, where inmates build life skills while participating in a vocational training program as they provide supervised care to our retired racehorses horses. If you are new to TRF, or are not familiar with our TRF Second Chances Program, please take the time to watch this brief video. You’ll be glad you did; and you will understand why our mission is so important.</p>			
			<p>TRF provides rescue, rehabilitation and permanent placement to abused, neglected or at risk equines. Life long sanctuary is provided to those equines unable to find permanent homes; and education, advocacy and equine support is offered throughout the community.</p>
			<p>Founded in 1983, the Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation’s mission is clear and simply stated: To save Thoroughbred horses no longer able to compete on the racetrack from possible neglect, abuse and slaughter.</p>
